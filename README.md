# üéÆ UE5 Gameplay Prototypes
This repository is a collection of gameplay mechanics prototypes developed in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). The project serves as a showcase of personal experiments and a playground for recreating and understanding core systems from popular games.

# üïπÔ∏è Prototypes Included
### Ultra Hand - The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
A physics-based prototype focused on manipulating, moving, and combining objects. The system allows players to attach different components together to create custom structures and vehicles, all powered by UE5's physics engine.

### D-Pad System - Tunic
This prototype recreates the quick-access D-Pad item selection system from the game Tunic. It's designed to be a streamlined and intuitive way to manage and use items during gameplay, optimized for controller input but also functional with a keyboard.

### Item System - Astroneer
A prototype of a modular crafting and item management system inspired by Astroneer. The system includes item creation, inventory management, and a basic resource collection loop, demonstrating how to handle and interact with in-game items.
